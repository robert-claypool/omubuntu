# omubuntu starship configuration (user stub)
#
# The active Starship config is managed by omubuntu:
#   ~/.config/omubuntu/starship.toml
#
# ~/.zshrc sets STARSHIP_CONFIG to point at the managed file.
# To customize your prompt, edit ~/.zshrc (or unset STARSHIP_CONFIG) and create
# your own ~/.config/starship.toml.
